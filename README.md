# Flatiron Curriculum Online Proposals

Due to the architecture of our online curriculum, changes to order, presence,
deletion of various lessons must be batched and "rolled out" on a periodic
basis.

Presently roll outs occur 2-3 per quarter.

## Process

Changes are to be recorded as Issues in this repository.

Changes can be "thumbs-upped" as a means of expressing support.

Where appropriate, as issues become batched into releases, they will be
documented here.

This plan is subject to change.
